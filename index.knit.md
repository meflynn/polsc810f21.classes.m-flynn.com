Welcome, this page will serve as the homepage for POLSC 810 Security Studies Research Methods (Fall 2021).


## Course Objectives

This course introduces methods in history and political science used to produce research in the field of security studies. Students will investigate humanities and social sciences methodology through selected readings and research exercises. The course teaches students how to formulate an academic research inquiry and frame it within the secondary academic literature, build a causal thesis, collect evidence (primary sources/data), and evaluate a thesis with primary documents, case studies or statistical analysis. In addition, students will initiate and revise a research proposal in this course that will eventually become a research paper in POLSC/HIST 815.
